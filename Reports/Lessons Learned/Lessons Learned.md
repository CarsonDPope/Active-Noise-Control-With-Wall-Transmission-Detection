# Lessons Learned

This document should be used as an ongoing documentation of the following:

- Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well? 
- What unanticipated problems occurred? 
- What would you do differently if you were to do it over again? 
- What “best practices” have you identified? 
- What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

Create a section addressing each of the above questions. 

Unanticipated problems -
Arduino Uno Wifi Rev2's SPI bus does not connect to the same pins as Arduino R3 despite pinout on website saying so. This is according to full schematic and several forums.
