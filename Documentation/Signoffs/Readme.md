Each subsystem designed for this project is researched and articulated here. Each .md uses outside sources and datasheets to prove why specific components were used and why we believed they would prove effective in our project when put together.

Each subsystem signoff will have the following sections:
- Function of the Subsystem
- Constraints
- Buildable Schematic
- Analysis
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
