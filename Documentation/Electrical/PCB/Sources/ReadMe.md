- This contains the gerber files in order to purchase the input and error subsystem PCBs.
- ## Relevant design notes
- The polarity shown on the PCB design for the electrolytic capacitors is in a few cases backwards, therefore it is advised to read the traces and consult the schematic before any polarized 
  capacitors are soldered on the PCB.
- The I/O and supply ports were not placed on the PCB with ports therefore in order to connect the PCB to other elements it is recommended to consult the schematic and solder wires in the 
  appropriate places.
