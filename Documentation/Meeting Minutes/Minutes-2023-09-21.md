### Meeting Notes 9/21/2023
Attendance: Carson, Caleb, Dylan, Jared
### General Updates
For the minimally functional prototype, out main goal will be to lower noise in a very small area using at least two speakers, or a speaker array.

Mounting, input/error are close to being validated. 

Output and power still require more work and design to be validated.


### Individual Updates
- Carson: Got Bluetooth signoff validated and approved
- Caleb: Worked on power signoff's analysis to get it validated. Also continued with output research
- Dylan: Worked on power signoff's analysis. Worked on the PCB design for input/error
- Jalene: Worked on power signoff
- Jared: Assisted in power signoff with the schematic and made mounting signoff images

### Future actions
- Carson: Will focus on both coding the prototype and secondarily helping out other teammates when needed.
- Caleb: Will spend more time in the output signoff while regarding the speakers
- Dylan: Will work on the input/error PCB and updating the power signoff
- Jalene: Will continue to primarily work on the power signoff to get it approved
- Jared: Will continue to work on power and mounting signoff
