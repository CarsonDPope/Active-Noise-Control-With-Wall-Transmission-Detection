### Meeting Notes 4/19/2023
We want to finish the main processor signoff. 
Changes to make/change:
- Make the math for the main processor speed less ambiguous. 
- Show audio codec has two ADCs per channel.
- Show the power and connections (directions the power goes, etc.)

We should be able to complete the signoff by tonight. A consensus is made that the error microphone will be wired. The input and error signoffs should look very similar.
The safety training will likely be completed at the beginning of next semester as we don't need the Captsone lab right now.
