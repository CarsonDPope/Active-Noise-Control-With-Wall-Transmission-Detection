#Meeting Notes 1/26/2023
Discussed and created team contract. We have no designated leader and would like to focus on giving each member an equal and flexible workload. Discord will be used for primary communication and informal sharing of progress. 

Meetings will be based on points that each member can add to a list the week before the meeting. We will have a dedicated secretary that writes down notes. Conflicts will be decided by majority vote. Important deadlines will have a group-given deadline of two days before its designated due date.
