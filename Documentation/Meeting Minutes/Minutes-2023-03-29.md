# Meeting Notes 3/29/2023
### Individual topics to work on for the detail design:
- Jared: Create Markdown file, work with Carson
- Carson: Hardware Architecture of needed components excel sheet
- Dylan: Create budget outline, include several needed peripherals(adc, dac, I/O ports, Communication protocals(I2C or SPI), ...)
- Jalene: Find out different ways to mount the device

### Sufficient details should be acquired to add onto the detail design. Currently, we need an ADC, DAC, Core, DSP. We need to analyze Memory Speed requirements that are necessary to get this device to work.
