### Meeting Notes 11/01/2023
Attendance: Caleb, Dylan, Jared, Jalene
### General Updates
Still working on functional prototype. That includes sending numbers from Blackfin, through Arduinos, to laptop machine learning, back to the Blackfin.
We need to work on fixing the DSP board.
### Individual Updates
- Carson: Worked on Arduino Bluetooth code with Jared and Caleb and worked on Blackfin code. Worked with Dylan to receive and manipulate a signal from Arduino Nano. Machine learning algorithm does *something*, which is good
- Caleb: Worked with Caleb to transmit and receive information between Arduinos via BLE. 
- Dylan: Made Python code to receive serial signal from Arduino, data type issues are causing problems. Also assissted Jalene with power system setup.
- Jalene: Soldered buck converters and set up potentiometers to be at correct values. Configured power system to work with parts that came in.
- Jared: Worked with Caleb to transmit and receive information between Arduinos via BLE
### Future actions
- Carson: Update readme.md for new programs on the GitHub to be more descriptive  
- Caleb: Speaker and power amp integration and help with SPI
- Dylan: Help fix the Blackfin and test SPI code. Update the 
- Jalene: Work on further connecting each subsystem together with the power  
- Jared: Help fix the Blackfin and test SPI code
