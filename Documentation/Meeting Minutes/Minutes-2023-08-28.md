### Meeting Notes 8/28/2023
Attendance: Carson, Caleb, Dylan, Jalene, Jared
### General Updates
Mounting needs to be detailed and fleshed out for all our designs' signoffs. Shape will be similar to a rectangular wireless speaker
We may have all the power be stacked on the main processor PCB 

### Individual Updates
- Carson: Did some maintenance on the GitHub and reviewed meeting notes. Need to figure out timing constraints on the Bluetooth signoff. 
- Caleb: Updated speaker signoff including the constraints and learned more about the speaker that will be used. 
- Dylan: Did research on different kinds of components for the input signoff, but decided that the original should be kept. 
- Jalene: Did research on possible solutions to power each component, the best solution might be to use voltage dividers, more information on the current drop will be needed. 
- Jared: Need to use KiCad to redesign the error signoff schematic. Need to figure out mounting and positioning relative to the speakers for error constraints. Need a component for differential to single output.
