# Meeting Notes 2/15/2023

### Choosing to wait on our conceptual design until good feedback is given on project proposal. 
### We may need to revise the proposed budget after coming up with new components such as GPUs for the machine learning and mounting equipment to get the device off the floor.
### During the project's production, the team should be able to share knowledge so that any individual can answer any question about the project, so we will plan for that.
