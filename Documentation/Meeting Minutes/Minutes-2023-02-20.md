# Meeting Notes 2/20/2023

### Discussed the block diagram required for the conceptual design. We need to expand the block diagram to include as much as possible. We decided that we want to finish our first draft of the conceptual design before preparing our proposal presentation. We would like two full days of working on the conceptual before working on the presentation.

### Before next meeting:
* Everyone: Read through conceptual document on GutHub. Find which part of the project each individual would be most helpful on. Do safety training and LinkeIn learning
* Jared: Create Overleaf and make outline/sections and share it with team
