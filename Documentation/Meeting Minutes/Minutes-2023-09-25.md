### Meeting Notes 9/25/2023
Attendance: Carson, Caleb, Dylan, Jared, Jalene
### General Updates
All signoffs have been successfully validated!

Research needs to be done to figure out how many speakers are needed per window:
- How many speakers are needed
- How to send an amplified signal to each speaker
- How those will connect to the main processor
- How all of these will connect to power
- This will go off the assumption that the sound pressure we are cancelling is equal in all parts, meaning we only still need one input and error mic

Minimally functional prototype definition: Can emit sounds that reduce sound in a small definable space. 


### Individual Updates
- Carson: Helped research speakers and supported Caleb with output
- Caleb: Helped finish power validity signoff and worked on presentation
- Dylan: Worked on personal presentation
- Jalene: Worked on presentation. Did research on more wall-worts
- Jared: Same as last week, worked on mounting and input/error

### Future actions
- Carson: Will support all other team members, specifically on power and output. Will work on coding the main processor
- Caleb: Will research speaker coverage and the number of speakers needed per window.
- Dylan: Continue of presentation and focus on power and mounting signoffs
- Jalene: Will continue to work on power signoff
- Jared: Will continue to update mounting and power signoff
