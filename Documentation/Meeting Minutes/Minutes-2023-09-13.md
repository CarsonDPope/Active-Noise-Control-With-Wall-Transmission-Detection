### Meeting Notes 9/5/2023
Attendance: Carson, Caleb, Dylan, Jalene, Jared
### General Updates
Top priorities are to finish the mounting and power signoff.
### Individual Updates
- Carson: Close to finishing the communication signoff. Helped others on their assignments.
- Caleb: Got feedback on the speaker signoff, more math is needed to find how to cancel noise within the a cone. Use research papers to find the radius of the cancel output, for example.
- Dylan: Worked on PCB for input/error subsystem and update their signoffs
- Jalene: Worked on power signoff and corrections. Feedback from Roberts include requiring circuit analysis and a buildable schematic.
- Jared: Worked on the PCB with Dylan.

### Future actions
- Carson: Will continue to help others with their signoffs.
- Caleb: Find research papers to figure out the speaker math required for an acceptable signoff.
- Dylan: Help with mounting signoff. After that, finish the PCB tracing.
- Jalene: Will work first on buildable schematic, then the circuit analysis.
- Jared: Will work on mounting design
