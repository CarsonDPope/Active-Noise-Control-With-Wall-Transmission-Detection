### Meeting Notes 10/19/2023
Attendance: Caleb, Dylan, Carson, Jared
### General Updates
We need to order PCB when we get sign in information.
Our grade for minimally functional design is low, sitting around 10 days in.
We should try to have split meetings every week due to our different schedules.

### Individual Updates
- Carson: Code SPI and machine learning
- Caleb:  Supported Dylan
- Dylan: Soldered Header Pins on Blackfin
- Jalene: Supported Jared
- Jared: Code BLE on Arduino

### Future actions
- Carson: Code with Python to make SPI and machine learning code for laptop.
- Caleb: Code the receiving an (unknown board) Arduino to take a BLE signal and send it to USB port into the laptop with serial communication. Communicate with Jared to match BLE IDs
- Dylan: Use Python to write code that is able to communicate back and forth with the serial communication incoming from an Arduino via USB.
- Jalene: 
- Jared: Code the Arduino Uno R4 to receive a signal from SPI and send it to another Arduino via BLE
