Attendance: Dylan, Jared, Caleb
### General Updates
Power signoff is finished, output is the final thing left to work on.

Minimally functional design is our next goal.

### Individual Updates

- Caleb: Made progress on the output 
- Dylan: Helped with power signoff and helped with the PCB for input/error
- Jalene: Helped finish the power signoff
- Jared: Completed ordering for finished signoffs

### Future actions
- Carson: Continue programming the Bluetooth/Main processor/Machine learning and apply them when parts arrive
- Caleb: Will finish up output signoff
- Dylan: Solder input and error PCBs when they arrive and support other team members
- Jalene: Communicate with Dylan to figure out next steps and work on power when the parts arrive
- Jared: Download the Arduino IDE to work on the programming with Carson and check with mounting 3D printing. Check with Carson to help with programming
