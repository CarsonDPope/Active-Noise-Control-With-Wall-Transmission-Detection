### Meeting Notes 10/24/2023
Attendance: Caleb, Dylan, Carson, Jared
### General Updates
Most progress involves software being made and updated. Actual testing needs to be done to see if everything works.
Goal of experimental analysis is to go measure each of the "measures of success" from the conceptual design and see how much they will be achieved. 
### Individual Updates
- Carson: Code on DSP board 
- Caleb:  Code for new Arduino to communicate via BLE and USB
- Dylan: Python code for laptop to take digital outputs from USB into a .wav file
- Jalene: Assisted Jared with Arduino R4 Code
- Jared: Code for Arduino R4 SPI and BLE communication
### Future actions
- Carson: Have a meeting with Dr. Austin for resources such as a speaker and Dr. Roberts for help with code issues the group is having. Finish machine learning code
- Caleb: Find a new usable Arduino to code on and work with Jared to test if Arduinos can communicate. Work on experimental analysis measures of success.
- Dylan: Refactor Python code to increase readability. Work on experimental analysis measures of success.
- Jalene: Work on experimental analysis measures of success.
- Jared: Continue working on Arduino R4 code with Carson.
