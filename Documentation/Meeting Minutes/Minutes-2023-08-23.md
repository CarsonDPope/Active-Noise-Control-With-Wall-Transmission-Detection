### Meeting Notes 8/23/2023
- First Meeting of Fall 2023
- Attendance: Carson, Dylan, Jalene, Jared
### General Updates
- A temporary meeting time will be Monday at 11am. 
- Design of the mounting is still undecided: We could either have a 3D-Printed 'box' that holds all the components or a 3D-Printed custom built design that can screw each component into place or a PCB design.
- We will need a mounting subsystem signoff.   
- We will need a software subsystem signoff. 
- Everyone should review their training and complete if not done.
### Individual Updates
- Jared: Will update error subsystem based on Dr. Roberts' notes. Will have to include a method to send the error subsystem's output with the input subsystem's output and collaborate with Dylan.
- Carson: Looked into Bluetooth system; Arduino Uno WiFi Rev. 2 can connect to the main subsystem for wireless communication. Bluetooth will likely be used over WiFi for communication. Carson will work on the wireless subsystem signoff. 
- Dylan: Reviewed signoffs. Dylan's input signoff might change to include a wall microphone and pre-amp stage which may need new DC voltage values. 
- Jalene: A new component must be picked for the power subsystem to include variable DC voltage values for new components. Research will be done to find which architectures can output variable DC voltage values.
