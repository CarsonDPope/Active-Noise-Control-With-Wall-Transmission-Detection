# Meeting Notes 3/22/2023
### Reviewed discussion about the block diagram. Simplify design work on power. Changes need to be made regarding constraints on our conceptual design, make them more specific based on the comments. Also change the ethics and standards
### The timeline needs to change to get rid of 'build a little, test a little,' we don't have time to implement that. We want to focus on getting our project to work as proof of concept.
- Carson: Work on block diagram
- All: Rework constraints on conceptual design document
### We will meet Friday 1pm and Saturday 12pm to revise and finalize document
