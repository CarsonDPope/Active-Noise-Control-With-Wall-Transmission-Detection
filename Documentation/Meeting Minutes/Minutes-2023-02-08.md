# Meeting Notes 2/8/2023
### Shared information on researched topics, constraints, and regulations. We also plan to talk to Van Neste to see if we can get access to labs.
### Worked and finished an email to be sent to Atkins for student/teacher responses, waiting for supervisor to review. We plan on having a few of our team members making the survey the next day around 3pm.
