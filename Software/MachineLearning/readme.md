## Function:  
broadbandGen.py: Creates a series of noise recordings in specified frequency bands and exports to a csv file for training the neural network. 

CapstoneMachineLearning.py: Uses the data generated in 'broadbandGen.py' to train and fit a convolutional neural network. The particular architecture was designed with ease and speed and mind and can be improved upon. The trained model is then used in [DATA_READ.py](Active-Noise-Control-With-Wall-Transmission-Detection/Software/LaptopSide) and outputs which approximate filter should be used.

## Future Work:
The neural network could be imporved upon by changing the frequency bands that is trained such as training with overlapping bands instead of separate bands.

## HOW TO USE:
broadbandGen.py: Execute the python script.

CapstoneMachineLearning.py: In the same folder as the csv file generated by broadbandGen.py, execute the CapstoneMachineLearning script.

Both scripts were written for Python 3.13

### Required Pyton Extensions
    In order to use this program you must also have the following python extensions installed:
    -numpy
    -tensorflow
    -keras
    -sklearn
    -matplotlib
    -cv2
    In most cases these extensions can be installed using pip install in the command prompt, for example to install numpy
    use the following command (pip install numpy), otherwise 
    these extensions and how to easily install them can be found online.
