The purpose of this file is to be uploaded into an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi device to:
- Communicate between the Sharkfin via SPI
- Communicate with another Arduino device via BLE

## ArduinoUno.ino (unfinished)
-  The final Arduino file that will be used to run the project
-  This is unimplemented, I would recommend using the two test files below, they run automatically and output to the terminal for debugging


## BLE_Test.ino
-  Test code for communicating with the Arduino NANO IOT via BLE

## SPI_Test.ino
-  Test code for communicating with the Blackfin-B706-EZ-Kit-Mini via SPI
