# Active Noise Cancellation with Wall Transmission Detection

## Executive Summary

Construction noise has increased throughout Tennessee Technological University as it expands. Even though the expansion of our alma mater is a generally good thing, the added noise distracts students during times of instruction. Our team is working on developing a proof of concept for an active noise cancelling solution to the growing noise pollution problem that uses the vibrations in the outer wall of a room as the input signal. 

## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.

( Will be done later )

## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!

( Will be done later )

## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.

( Will be done later )

## About Us

### Team

**Jalene Joyce**

**Dylan Mitchell**

**Carson Pope** is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with a minor in Music Performance. Carson has an interest in telecommunications, signal processing, and machine learning. For this project, Carson focused on the design of the signal processor hardware along with the design of the noise cancelling software. Carson also focused on machine learning for better acoustic room response.

Students and Faculty of Brown Hall, write paragraph about this group
    
Schools in general (smaller paragraph)

### Recognitions

We would like to thank **Jesse Roberts** for his contributions and feedback throughout our capstone experience as our supervisor.

We would like to thank **Dr. Jeffrey Austen** for advice and guidance during the early stages of our capstone. 

## Repo Organization

### [Reports](/Reports)

The [Project Proposal](/Reports/Project%20Proposal/Project_ProposalV2.pdf) report addresses key questions about the project. It states exactly what the problem is and what the solution plans to achieve. 

The [Conceptual Design and Planning](/Reports/Conceptual%20Design/Conceptual_DesignV2.pdf) report provides all specifications and constraints the project must follow. This includes standards and regulations that must be followed.

The [Experimentation](/Reports/Experimentation) report shows [finish later]

The [Poster](/Reports/Poster) is [finish later]

The [Final Report](/Reports/Final%20Report) includes [finish later]

The [Lessons Learned](/Reports/Lessons%20Learned/Lessons%20Learned.md) files shows all lessons learned throughout the process. It includes lessons in both team communication, project management, and technical knowledge.

### [Documentation](/Documentation)

All documentation is included in the above folder. Folders for the files including schematics and images are included in their respective folders. All files related to a specific signoff are then in a subfolder labeled appropriately.

Documentation include all schematics, images, models, and designs used in the project. 

The [Signoffs](/Documentation/Signoffs) folder houses all approved detail designs. These designs are for each subsystem and shows all constraints. The signoffs should convince the reader that all constraints are met as well as link to all other relevant documentation in their respective folders. These signoffs should also link any software in which is relevant.

The [Meeting Minutes](/Documentation/Meeting%20Minutes) folder contains dated minutes for all team meetings. This allows the reader to analyze current and previous progress in a time based manner. 

### [Software](/Software)

All software will be located in this directory. For each specific problem or system, a folder will be created that contains all relevant code along with a readme that explains installation, compiling, executing of the code.
