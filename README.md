# Active Noise Cancellation with Wall Transmission Detection

## Executive Summary

Construction noise has increased throughout Tennessee Technological University as it expands. Even though the expansion of our alma mater is a generally good thing, the added noise distracts students during times of instruction. Our team is working on developing a proof of concept for an active noise cancelling solution to the growing noise pollution problem that uses the vibrations in the outer wall of a room as the input signal.
