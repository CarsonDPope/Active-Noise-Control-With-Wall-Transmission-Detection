# Active Noise Cancellation with Wall Transmission Detection

## Executive Summary

Construction noise has increased throughout Tennessee Technological University as it expands. Even though the expansion of our alma mater is a generally good thing, the added noise distracts students during times of instruction. Our team is working on developing a proof of concept for an active noise cancelling solution to the growing noise pollution problem that uses the vibrations in the outer wall of a room as the input signal. 

## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.

## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!

## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.


## About Us

### Team

Give a brief bio for each team member and their broad contribution to the project (no need to be terribly specifc).

**Jalene Joyce**

**Dylan Mitchell**

**Carson Pope** is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with a minor in Music Performance. Carson has an interest in telecommunications, signal processing, and machine learning. For this project, Carson focused on the design of the signal processor hardware along with the design of the noise cancelling software. Carson also focused on machine learning for better acoustic room response.

### Faculty Supervisor

[Jesse  Roberts, M.S.](https://www.tntech.edu/directory/engineering/faculty/jesse-roberts.php) is a lecturer for Tennessee Technological University. He received both his Bachelor's and Master's in Electrical Engineering at Tennessee Technological University. He is currently pursuing a Doctorate of Philosophy in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University.

### Stakeholders

Tell a bit about the customer for the project. Also discuss any other groups (specific or general) that are expected to be impacted by the project.

Students and Faculty of Brown Hall, write paragraph about this group
    
Schools in general (smaller paragraph)

### Recognitions

Use this space to recognize anyone that you feel has had an impact on the project. Be sure to recognize the work of previous teams if you referenced it for style or content. 

We would like to thank **Jesse Roberts** for his contributions and feedback throughout our capstone experience as our supervisor.

We would like to thank **Dr. Jeffrey Austen** for advice and guidance during the early stages of our capstone. 

## Repo Organization

Give the layout of the repo and what can be found where. Make it easy on those who are interested by making the headings of the various things in this section clickable links to the relevant folder or file in the repo.


### Reports

In the reports section of this repository information about the individual expectations for the reports and how they should be housed is provided.
